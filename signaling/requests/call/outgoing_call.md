# `outgoing_call` call request

Send a `SIP INVITE` to make the outgoing call. A [`calling`](../../events/call/calling.md) event will be sent back after `outgoing_call` request start processing.

Notice that this request must be associated to a [SDP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/SDP) offer via `jsep` property (there's no way to send an offerless `INVITE`). This will generate a `SIP INVITE` and send it according to the instructions. While a `100 Trying` will not be notified back to the user, a `180 Ringing` will, in a [`ringing`](../../events/call/ringing.md) event.

If the call is declined, or any other error occurs, a [`hangup`](../../events/call/hangup.md) event will be sent back. If the call is accepted, instead, an [`accepted`](../../events/call/accepted.md) event will be sent back to the user, along with the [SDP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/SDP) answer originated by the callee via `jsep` property.

Notice that early-media supported via `183` responses. In case a `183` response is received, it's sent back to the user, along with the [SDP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/SDP) answer originated by the callee via `jsep` property, in a [`progress`](../../events/call/progress.md) event.

In case the caller received a [`progress`](../../events/call/progress.md) event, the following [`accepted`](../../events/call/accepted.md) event will not contain a [SDP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/SDP) answer, as the one received in the session progress event will act as the [SDP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/SDP) answer for the session.

`call_id` property must be generated by the requester ([8.1.1.4 Call-ID](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3261#section-8.1.1.4)).
