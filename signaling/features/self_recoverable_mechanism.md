# Self-recoverable mechanism

The self-recoverable mechanism is designed to reestablish the connection between **WebTrit apps** and **WebTrit Core** while restoring the state of the client session. This feature ensures that in the event of a disconnection, a **WebTrit app** can seamlessly reconnect to the **WebTrit Core** and resume operations, preserving the continuity and context of the ongoing session.
